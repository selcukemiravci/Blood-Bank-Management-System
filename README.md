## Description
This project was made by Computer Science Undergraduate students from the University of Calgary
for the CPSC 471 Fall 2022 - Database Management Systems course.


## Requirements:
The following technologies and tools were used to build our project:
- ReactJS (JavaScript)
- Node.js
- CSS
- HTML
- MySQL

### Recommended IDE:
1. VsCode


## Downloading the project:
* Easiest way is to clone the repository:
    + [Blood Management System GitHub](https://github.com/selcukemiravci/Blood-Bank-Management-System)
    + Alternatively, if you're a TA or Professor, you need to move our code into a file system where you have permissions to run and compile code.

## Installation

### **<span style="color:red;">!!! Note !!!</span>** 
- **This section is only necessary if you want to download the source code and run in it at localhost in your local device.**

## Step 1: Node.js
In order to launch our project, you need to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version is recommended for most users)
\
After that, open up your terminal and check if `Node` is installed:
```
$ node -v
v16.13.0
```
Also, check if `npm` is installed, which comes with `Node`
```
$ npm -v
8.1.0
```
## Step 2: Clone GitHub Repository
On your terminal, do the following to clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Joey-mi/social-engineering-quiz/tree/main-page
```

## Step 3: Check JSON File
Go to the ```package.json``` file in your local machine and make sure you have the following script properties:
```javascript
"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies
Execute the following commands in your terminal before starting our project :

```
$ npm install
```
This will download all the dependencies defined in the ```package.json``` file and into a ```node_modules``` folder.\
This folder will created in the root directory of the ```social-engineering-quiz``` folder in your local machine


## Step 6: Starting the App
Go to the root directory of the project and then start the app:
```
$ cd social-engineering-quiz    // first, go to root directory of the project...
$ npm start                     // then, start the app in the root directory
```

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Other Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
